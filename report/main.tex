\begin{abstract}

In this project, we present CycBot --- a~soft robot designed for non-verbal communication with humans. The~robot's design incorporates silicone materials and 3D~printing. Our robot was inspired by~toys like Furbies~\cite{furby} and Tamagotchis~\cite{tamagotchi}, aiming to create an~engaging interaction experience. We~achieved a~successful design and fabrication of CycBot, demonstrating its ability to~express emotions using soft robotics actuator. In~our Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) experiment, we evaluated the~robot's effectiveness in~conveying emotions and engaging users.
