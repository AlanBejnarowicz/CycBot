\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Design of the robot}

Our robot, CycBot, was designed in Fusion 360 and fabricated using a combination of 3D printing and silicone molding. The robot's body consists of a 3D-printed frame, while the body and ears are made from Ecoflex 00-30 silicone. The robot uses one servo motor to rotate head, three air pumps, and two air valves to control the inflation and deflation of the ears. To make robot more human-like we cast `belly' and ears using skin-colored silicone. TO keep robot upright we poured small amount of hard silicone on the bottom of the robot. The robot is controlled using an Arduino microcontroller, which manages the servo motor and air pumps/valves. The robot's behavior is programmed to respond to human interactions, allowing it to express different emotions through ear movements and head rotations. 

\subsection{Human Robot Interactions (HRI)}
We designed our robot to show five distinct emotions: interested, happiness, annoyed, and sadness. Each emotion is expressed through a combination of ear movements and head rotations. We designed our robot to have human input, Inflatable belly of the robot has a pressure sensor that detects when a human is touching it. Robot can detect two types of touch: light touch
and strong touch.

\subsection{Robot behaviour}

Our robot operates based on a state machine that tries to interact with humans by expressing different emotions. The robot starts in an idle state, where it waits for human interaction. To attract human attention, the robot periodically enters the interested state, characterized by slow head swiping movements. When a human touches the robot's belly lightly, it transitions to the happy state, expressing joy by moving its ears one at a time. If the robot experiences a strong touch, it becomes annoyed, demonstrated by rapid head movements. Whole interaction cycle is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cycbot-state}.
