\subsection{Design of the~robot}

\par Our robot, CycBot, was designed in Fusion~360 and fabricated using a~combination of 3D~printing and silicone molding. The~robot's body consists of a~3D-printed frame, while the~body and ears are made from Ecoflex~00-30 silicone. The~robot uses one servo motor to rotate head, three air pumps, and two air valves to control the inflation and deflation of the~ears. To make the~robot more human-like, we cast `belly' and ears using skin-coloured silicone. To keep the~robot upright we poured small amount of hard silicone on~the~bottom of its belly. The~robot is controlled using the~Arduino~Uno microcontroller~\cite{arduino-uno}, which manages the~servo motor and air pumps/valves. The robot's behaviour is programmed to respond to human interactions, allowing it to express different emotions through ear movements and head rotations.

\par We designed our robot to show five distinct emotions: interested, happiness, annoyed and sadness. Each emotion is expressed through a combination of ear movements and head rotations, based on the~human input. The inflatable belly of the robot has a~pressure sensor that detects when a human is touching it and for how long.
